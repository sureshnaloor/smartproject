# WBS Hierarchy Verification Steps

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sureshmenon/Desktop/projects/smartconstruct
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the Project WBS View**:
   - Navigate to the project list page
   - Click on a project to view its details
   - Go to the WBS Structure tab/page

3. **Check Top-Level Item Creation**:
   - Click the "Add WBS Item" button
   - Verify the Parent WBS is "No Parent (Top Level)"
   - Verify the Type field shows only "Summary" option
   - Fill in other required fields
   - Click "Add WBS Item" to create it
   - Verify the new item appears in the WBS tree

4. **Check Child Item Creation for Summary Parent**:
   - Find a Summary item in the WBS tree
   - Click the "+" button next to it
   - In the modal, verify that:
     - Parent WBS shows the selected Summary item
     - Type dropdown is enabled and shows both "Summary" and "WorkPackage" options
   - Select "WorkPackage", fill in other fields, and create the item
   - Verify it appears as a child of the Summary item with the correct type

5. **Check Child Item Creation for WorkPackage Parent**:
   - Find a WorkPackage item in the WBS tree
   - Click the "+" button next to it
   - In the modal, verify that:
     - Parent WBS shows the selected WorkPackage item
     - Type dropdown shows only "Activity" option
   - Fill in required fields and create the item
   - Verify it appears as a child of the WorkPackage with the correct type

6. **Check Dynamic Form Field Updates**:
   - When Type is "Summary" or "WorkPackage", verify:
     - Budget field is enabled
     - Date fields are not shown
   - When Type is "Activity", verify:
     - Budget field is disabled or shows "N/A"
     - Date fields are shown and can be filled in

7. **Check Activity Item Constraints**:
   - Verify that Activity items don't have a "+" button, or it's disabled
   - This ensures that Activities cannot have children

## Expected Behavior

- The Type dropdown in the Add WBS Modal should never be completely disabled
- The Type options should update correctly based on the selected parent
- Top-level items should only allow "Summary" type
- Summary items should allow "Summary" or "WorkPackage" children
- WorkPackage items should only allow "Activity" children
- Activity items should not allow any children
