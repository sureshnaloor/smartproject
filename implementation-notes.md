# WBS Hierarchy Implementation - Fix Notes

## Issue Fixed

The add-wbs-modal.tsx component had an issue where the WBS type selection was not working correctly according to the hierarchical rules:
- Top-level items should only be "Summary" type
- Under Summary items, users should be able to select "Summary" or "WorkPackage"
- Under WorkPackage items, users should only be able to select "Activity"

Specifically, the WBS type dropdown was being incorrectly disabled when it should have been enabled with the appropriate options.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed the `disabled` Attribute**:
   The original code had `disabled={allowedTypes.length <= 1}` which was incorrectly disabling the dropdown even when selection should have been possible. We removed this condition to allow selection when appropriate.

2. **Implemented Reactive State for Allowed Types**:
   - Added a useState hook for tracking allowed types: `const [allowedTypes, setAllowedTypes] = useState<string[]>(["Summary"]);`
   - Created a useEffect that updates the allowed types whenever the parent item changes

3. **Fixed Logic Flow**:
   - Separated the concerns between updating allowed types in the dropdown and actually setting the form value
   - Ensured the parent selection handler correctly updates the type field value
   - Made sure the form reset properly applies the correct initial values

4. **Improved Type Safety**:
   - Added better fallback values to prevent empty arrays of allowed types
   - Added proper type assertions to avoid TypeScript errors

## How It Works Now

1. When the user opens the modal, it initializes with "Summary" as the only allowed type for top-level items
2. When the user selects a parent:
   - If the parent is a Summary item, the dropdown updates to show "Summary" and "WorkPackage" options
   - If the parent is a WorkPackage item, the dropdown updates to show only "Activity" option
   - The selected type is automatically set to a valid value based on the parent
3. When the user changes the type, the form fields update to show/hide appropriate fields:
   - Summary and WorkPackage types don't show date fields
   - Activity type disables the budget field and shows date fields

## Testing

A comprehensive test plan has been created in test-plan.md to verify the correct implementation of the WBS hierarchy rules.
